    "1. Generation Node: Produce Initial Attempt\n",
    "The agent generates a first response based on the prompt, prioritizing speed and creativity over perfection — for example, drafting a quick YouTube video script idea to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reflection Node: Self-Critique and Plan\n",
    "The agent reviews its own output, identifying weaknesses, gaps, or missed opportunities. It creates an improvement plan — for instance, noting that the video script needs a stronger hook or clearer structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Revision Node: Implement Improvements\n",
    "Using its self-critique, the agent revises the output. This may involve restructuring the content, adding missing details, or improving tone and flow until it aligns with the set goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation Node: Check Against Goals\n",
    "The improved draft is assessed against predefined criteria (e.g., engagement, coherence, audience fit). If it passes, the workflow ends; if not, it loops back for further reflection and revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Output: Deliver Enhanced Result\n",
    "Once the content meets the desired standard, the agent outputs a polished version — for example, a refined YouTube video script ready for production or review.\n",

      "- Addressing emerging ethical and legal challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent developments indicate Japan is moving towards more structured AI governance. The government has established expert panels bringing together academics, industry leaders, and policymakers to create adaptive regulatory frameworks [1]. These panels aim to develop guidelines that balance technological potential with robust societal safeguards.\n",
